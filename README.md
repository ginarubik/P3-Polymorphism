/**
 * According to the creation myths of the Abrahamic religions, Adam and Eve were the first Humans to wander the Earth.
 *
 * You have to do God’s job.
 * The creation method must return an array of length 2 containing objects representing Adam and Eve.
 * The first object in the array should be an instance of the class Man.
 * The second should be an instance of the class Woman.
 * Both objects have to be subclasses of Human.
 *
 * Your job is to implement the Human, Man and Woman classes, and then
 * 'populate' the Human array, in the create() method.
 *
 * Fun, optional: Add some specific methods to each class!
